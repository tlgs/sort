# sort

A study of sorting algorithms using C.

The focus is on the algorithms and not on _general functionality_;
there is only an interface for `int`.

## Motivation

- attain an understanding of sorting algorithms beyond Wikipedia's initial paragraph
- take a C refresher by going through (most of) the [Modern C](https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/) book
- mess around with [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) for simple build tasks

## Benchmark

A rather simple and unscientific benchmark comparison is done with the `benchmark.ps1` PowerShell script.
